This project counts the number of 1s in a valid binary number.

Here is a quick test of the program:

Use Cases: 

 - This program could be modified to detect if a user is entering in anything other than a desired input, as it checks to see if the input only has 1s and 0s in it. 

Problems:

 - I do not see any glaring issues with this code. All keyboard inputs can be entered in, but only returs valid if the user enters in 1s or 0s.
